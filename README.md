# GlobalMarchAPI
This is placeholder repository for an API to assist march organizers in any locale.

I am going to need help with this.  
I will think about its components and then announce that it exists.  
There is a spirit here I want to preserve.

This will be part of the March PnP toolkit.

Thank you for your patience and consideration. 

You are loved.
